# Sparnatural - A natural way of building SPARQL queries

Sparnatural is a **visual SPARQL query builder written in javascript**.

It supports the creation of basic graph patterns with the selection of values with autocomplete search or dropdown lists. It can be configured through a JSON-LD ontology file that defines the classes and properties to be presented in the component.

You can play with an **online demo at http://labs.sparna.fr/sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/**.

# Getting Started

To get started :

1. Read the following documentation;
2. Look at how things work in file `sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html`; 
3. In particular look at how the specifications are written by looking at [the source of `sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html`](https://github.com/sparna-git/Sparnatural/blob/master/sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html#L100)
4. Adapt `sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/index.html` by changing the configuration and adapting the SPARQL endpoint URL;

# Features

## Query Structure

### Basic query pattern

Select the type of entity to search...

![](documentation/1-screenshot-class-selection.png)

... then select the type of the related entity.

![](documentation/2-screenshot-object-type-selection.png)

In this case there is only one possible type of relation that can connect the 2 entities, so it gets selected automatically. Then select a value for the related entity, in this case in a dropdown list :

Congratulations, your first SPARQL query criteria is complete !

![](documentation/4-screenshot-criteria.png)

Now you can fetch the generated SPARQL query :

### "WHERE"

This enables to navigate the graph :

### "AND"

Combine criterias :

![](documentation/7-and.png)

### "OR"

Select multiple values for a criteria :

![](documentation/8-or.png)

## Values selection

Sparnatural offers currently 6 ways of selecting a value for a criteria : autocomplete field, dropdown list, simple string value, date range (year or date precision), date range with a search in a period name (e.g. "bronze age"), or no selection at all.

### Autocomplete field

### Dropdown list

![](documentation/10-list.png)

### String value (text search)

![](documentation/11-search.png)

### Date range (year or date precision)

![](documentation/12-time-date.png)

### Date range with search in period name

### No value selection

This is useful when a type a of entity is used only to navigate the graph, but without the ability to select an instance of these entities.

## Multilingual

Sparnatural is multilingual and supports displaying labels of classes and properties in multiple languages.


## Limitations

### Only basic graph patterns, no UNION, OPTIONAL, BIND, etc.

Sparnatural produces only basic graph patterns with VALUES. It does not support the creation of UNION, OPTIONAL, SERVICE, BIND, etc...

### SPARQL endpoint needs to be CORS-enabled

To send SPARQL queries to a service that is not hosted on the same domain name as the web page in which Sparnatural is included, the SPARQL endpoint needs to allow [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://enable-cors.org/).

# Integration

## Specification of classes and properties

The component is configurable using a JSON(-LD) ontology file. Look at the specification files under the `config` folders of the demos to get an idea. The file contains :

### Class definition

```json
    {
      "@id" : "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Museum",
      "@type" : "Class",
      "label": [
        {"@value" : "Museum", "@language" : "en"},
        {"@value" : "Musée","@language" : "fr"}
      ],
      "faIcon":  "fas fa-university"
    },
```

### Property definitions with domains and ranges

```json
    {
      "@id" : "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/museum",
      "@type" : "ObjectProperty",
      "subPropertyOf" : "sparnatural:AutocompleteProperty",
      "label": [
        {"@value" : "displayed at","@language" : "en"},
        {"@value" : "exposée à","@language" : "fr"}
      ],
      "domain": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Artwork",
      "range": "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Museum",
      "datasource" : "datasources:search_rdfslabel_bifcontains"
    },
```

### Using font-awesome icons

It is possible to directly use font-awesome icons in place of icons embedded in your application :

```json
"faIcon":  "fas fa-user",
```

## How to integrate Sparnatural in a webpage

Have a look at `index.html` in the demos folder to see how the component is integrated in a webpage.


## Map the query structure to a different graph structure

Map classes or properties in the config to a corresponding SPARQL property path or a corresponding class URI, using the `sparqlString` JSON key, e.g. :

```
    {
      "@id" : "http://labs.sparna.fr/sparnatural-demo-dbpedia/onto#bornIn",
      "@type" : "ObjectProperty",
      ...
      "sparqlString": "<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/birthPlace>/<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/country>",
    },
```

Then call `expandSparql` on the `sparnatural` instance by passing the original SPARQL query, to replace all mentions of original classes and properties URI with the corresponding SPARQL string :

```
queryString = sparnatural.expandSparql(queryString);
```
